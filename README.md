Project : Check 'N' Go

Description of the project :
Basic idea of this project is to provide the customers/borrowers with daily used items such as ( Musical items, Carpenter items, etc) on hourly bases.
The borrowers can use the items they want by paying half amount of the price of the item and after using they can return it to the store.
Borroewe can also use the borrow time option, they can borrow an item for a certain time period.
